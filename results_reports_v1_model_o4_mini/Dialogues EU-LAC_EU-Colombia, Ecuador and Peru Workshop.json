These discussions, part of a broader initiative involving multiple Latin American regions, aim to address challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and food waste. Key topics included agroecology, sustainable pesticide use, and strategies for reducing food loss. The dialogues facilitated exchanges between policymakers, public institutions, and private sector representatives, emphasizing shared values and commitments to sustainability.
