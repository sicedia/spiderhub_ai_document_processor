  "executive_summary": "On November 16, 2023, during the AI Alliance Assembly in Madrid, EU and Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries reaffirmed their commitment to a Digital Alliance aimed at enhancing cooperation on digital policy and regulatory frameworks for artificial intelligence (AI). Following a joint declaration in July 2023, participating nations, including Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico, proposed initiatives to promote convergence in AI regulation, emphasizing the need for best practice exchanges and the establishment of regulatory sandboxes. The upcoming EU Regulation on AI will set safety and rights-based requirements for AI systems, while fostering an environment for innovation across linguistic diversities. The statement highlights the importance of regular dialogue to ensure that AI development respects human rights and adapts to local contexts, ultimately supporting responsible and inclusive AI practices.",
