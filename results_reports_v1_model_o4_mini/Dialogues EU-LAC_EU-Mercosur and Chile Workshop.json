These dialogues, supported by the EU's Farm to Fork Strategy, focus on addressing climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation through strategic partnerships. The second workshop, held on May 16-17, 2022, facilitated discussions among policymakers and stakeholders on sustainable livestock production, food loss and waste, and soil health. Key figures emphasized the importance of the EU-MERCOSUR Free Trade Agreement and the need for inclusive food systems that align with international sustainability goals. The initiative will culminate in a bi-regional conference, promoting ongoing dialogue and the development of public-private partnerships to transition towards resilient food systems globally.",
