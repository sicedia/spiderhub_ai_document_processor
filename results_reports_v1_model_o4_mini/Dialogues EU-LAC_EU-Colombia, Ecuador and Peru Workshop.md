## Executive Summary

The European Union (EU) is actively fostering cooperation with Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru to transition towards sustainable food systems, as highlighted in the dialogues held on September 28-29, 2022. These discussions, part of a broader initiative involving multiple Latin American regions, aim to address challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and food waste.

The dialogues facilitated exchanges between policymakers, public institutions, and private sector representatives, emphasizing shared values and commitments to sustainability.
