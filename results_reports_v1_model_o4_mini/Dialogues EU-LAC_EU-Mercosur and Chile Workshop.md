## Executive Summary

The EU-Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) Dialogues on Sustainable Food Systems aim to foster collaboration between the European Union, MERCOSUR countries, and Chile to enhance sustainable agricultural practices. These dialogues, supported by the EU's Farm to Fork Strategy, focus on addressing climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation through strategic partnerships. The second workshop, held on May 16-17, 2022, facilitated discussions among policymakers and stakeholders on sustainable livestock production, food loss and waste, and soil health. Key figures emphasized the importance of the EU-MERCOSUR Free Trade Agreement and the need for inclusive food systems that align with international sustainability goals. The initiative will culminate in a bi-regional conference, promoting ongoing dialogue and the development of public-private partnerships to transition towards resilient food systems globally.
