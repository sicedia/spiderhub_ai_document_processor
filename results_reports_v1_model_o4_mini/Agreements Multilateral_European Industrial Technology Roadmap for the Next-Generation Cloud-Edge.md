# European Industrial Technology Roadmap for Next-Generation Cloud-Edge and Telco Cloud Developments

**Date**: 2024-07-10

**Location**: Brussels, Belgium

## Executive Summary

The European Industrial Technology Roadmap for the Next-Generation Cloud-Edge outlines strategic investments needed to develop competitive, secure, and climate-neutral cloud and edge services across Europe. It emphasizes the importance of digital sovereignty, interoperability, and the integration of emerging technologies like AI and quantum computing. The roadmap identifies critical technology and deployment priorities, including the establishment of open standards, the promotion of open-source solutions, and the enhancement of infrastructure to support a distributed edge-to-cloud continuum. The New Telco Cloud Thematic Roadmap complements this by focusing on the telecommunications sector's cloud environments, addressing challenges and recommendations for converged network and computing infrastructures. Together, these roadmaps aim to position Europe as a leader in digital infrastructure, fostering innovation and collaboration while ensuring compliance with European values and regulations.
