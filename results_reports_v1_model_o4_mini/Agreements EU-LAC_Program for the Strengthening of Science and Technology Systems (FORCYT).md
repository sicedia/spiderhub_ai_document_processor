# Strengthening Science and Technology Systems in Ibero-America: FORCYT Program Overview and Indicator Assessment

**Date**: 2022-01

**Location**: Madrid, España

## Executive Summary

The FORCYT program aims to enhance science and technology systems in Ibero-America by improving the production of indicators related to higher education, science, and technology. The report highlights significant progress in the region's statistical capabilities, driven by national efforts and regional cooperation since the 1990s. Despite advancements, challenges remain, including the heterogeneity of national systems, limited resources, and the need for better institutional relationships to access primary data. The report emphasizes the importance of developing new indicators, particularly in innovation and public perception of science, while also addressing the need for improved communication of statistical information to diverse audiences. Overall, the program seeks to foster a more robust statistical framework to support informed decision-making in science and technology policy across Ibero-America.
