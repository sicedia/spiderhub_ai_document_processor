# Horizon Europe Strategic Plan (2025-2027) and European Common Criteria-based Cybersecurity Certification Scheme

**Date**: 2024-03-20

**Location**: Brussels, Belgium

## Executive Summary

The European Commission's strategic plan for Horizon Europe (2025-2027) aims to address critical global challenges, including climate change, biodiversity loss, and digital transformation, while fostering a resilient and inclusive Europe. The plan emphasizes three key orientations: the green transition, the digital transition, and enhancing resilience and competitiveness. It commits at least 35% of its budget to climate action and 10% to biodiversity initiatives. The plan also outlines the establishment of a European Common Criteria-based cybersecurity certification scheme, enhancing cybersecurity standards and cooperation with the private sector. This comprehensive approach integrates research and innovation across various sectors, ensuring alignment with EU policies and promoting synergies with other funding programs to maximize impact and effectiveness. The strategic plan was developed through extensive stakeholder engagement, ensuring it meets the evolving needs of society and the economy.

## Characteristics

- The European Common Criteria-based cybersecurity certification scheme (EUCC) is established under Regulation (EU) 2019/881, focusing on roles, rules, and obligations for cybersecurity certification.
- The scheme builds on the Mutual Recognition Agreement of Information Technology Security Certificates (SOG-IS) and utilizes Common Criteria procedures.
- The European Cybersecurity Certification Group will oversee the scheme, ensuring cooperation with the private sector and creating specialized subgroups for effective implementation.
